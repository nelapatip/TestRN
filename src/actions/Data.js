The subcommittee considered the application of 21 CFR 50.52 (IDRAC <Link type=\"Regulatory\" id=\"28587\">28587</Link>) (Clinical investigations involving greater than minimal risk but presenting the prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects) to FDA-regulated clinical trials. The committee recommendations were based on discussions examining ethical issues in 3 hypothetical research case studies. <br/><br/>In the hypothetical case involving enrolling adolescents in an HIV vaccine clinical study the committee unanimously agreed that the term “adolescent” was too vague. The committee was also concerned about off-label use of an HIV vaccine for adults by adolescents. There was general agreement by the committee that HIV vaccine studies involving adolescents should be done in countries that have a sufficient population of adolescents at risk for HIV. If studies outside the US prove to be effective, the members believed that safety studies can then be conducted in US. The committee did not, however, consider what specific adolescent subgroups should be included.<br/><br/>Much of the committee discussion on the hypothetical study regarding inhaled corticosteroids focused on what “prospect of direct benefit” means. The committee specifically noted the ethical issues surrounding any decisions to place children on placebo instead of therapies that provide a direct benefit or decisions to withhold proven treatments to promote scientific knowledge. The majority of the members also argued that there is not enough information about each child in the study to say whether the potential benefits would apply equally to both the intervention and control groups. The majority of the committee viewed the run-in period (the period before a clinical trial begins when no treatment is given) of the hypothetical case as a risk, but not so risky that the study could not be done.<br/><br/>The committee considered the ethical issues of the appropriate selection of a subject population for the initial clinical development plan and in the design of a “first-in-children” clinical trial of human neurostem cells (HNSC) for neonatal hypoxic-ischemic injury products. The discussion of the committee focused on 2 distinct arguments. In the first argument, some members stated that if the trial did not include measureable outcomes, it should not be done. The opposing argument was that research with only incremental knowledge as an endpoint may have societal benefit and would be ethical with full disclosure of potential benefits and complications.",

RITUXAN is a recombinant chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody indicated for the treatment of B-cell non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). It is estimated that over one million patients have been administered RITUXAN worldwide.<br/>Based upon review of recent post marketing and clinical safety reports:<br/>- Cases of fatal Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) have been reported following off-label use of RITUXAN for the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases, including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and vasculitis. The patients with autoimmune diseases had a history of prior or concurrent immunosuppressive therapy and were diagnosed with PML within 12 months of their last infusion of RITUXAN. PML has also been reported in patients with autoimmune disease not treated with RITUXAN.<br/>- No cases of PML have been reported in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis.<br/>- Physicians treating patients with autoimmune diseases should consider PML in the differential<br/>diagnosis of patients reporting neurological symptoms and consultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated.<br/>- The efficacy and safety of RITUXAN for the treatment of autoimmune diseases other than rheumatoid arthritis has not been established.<br/><br/>The Canadian Product Monograph (CPM) has been revised to include information on PML.",

Docetaxel is a prescription chemotherapy drug used to treat different kinds of cancers. FDA is warning that docetaxel contains ethanol, also known as alcohol, which may cause patients to experience intoxication or feel drunk during and after treatment. FDA is revising the labels of all docetaxel drug products to warn about this risk. FDA recommends  Health care professionals to consider the alcohol content of docetaxel when prescribing the drug to patients, particularly in those whom alcohol intake should be avoided or minimized and when using it in conjunction with other medications.",

No cases of reconstitution errors have been reported in Canada.<br/>- Errors in the administered dose occurred in the first step of the reconstitution where only the nominal volume of the diluent<br/>vial (4.5 mL) was transferred to the concentrate vial, instead of the entire content (5.67 mL). This resulted in a more concentrated premix, leading to a higher dose of JEVTANA delivered.<br/>- Pharmacies should review worksheets used in the preparation of cabazitaxel to ensure that they instruct pharmacy staff to add the ENTIRE content of the diluent vial to the concentrate.<br/>- Where an automated software system is used to prepare the infusion solution, the system must be set up to allow withdrawal of the ENTIRE content of the diluent vial to add to the concentrate vial.",

Therefore, the CHMP has recommended the refusal of the granting of the marketing authorisation for KYNAMRO. <br/><br/>***",

XGEVA is a monoclonal antibody that binds to RANKL, a protein essential for maintenance of healthy bone. RANKL is also present in GCTB. The FDA reviewed XGEVA under its priority review program, which provides for an expedited review of drugs. XGEVA was granted orphan product designation because it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition. Common side effects included joint pain (arthralgia), headache, nausea, fatigue, back pain and extremity pain. The most common serious side effects were osteonecrosis (areas of dead bone) of the jaw and osteomyelitis (inflammation or infection of the bone). It is marketed by Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, Calif.",

The purpose of the workshop was for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), in collaboration with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, National Institutes of Drug Abuse, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to initiate a public discussion about the potential value of making naloxone more widely available outside of conventional medical settings to reduce the incidence of opioid overdose fatalities. Academia, government, industry experts, and patient advocates will be assembled to discuss which populations are at risk for opioid overdose and how public health groups are working together to curb the abuse of opioids. We will also seek to identify potential health concerns, social concerns, legal concerns, regulatory issues, and future research needs related to making naloxone more widely available.",

These amendments modify the Food and Drug Regulations in Part I of Schedule F (IDRAC <Link type=\"Regulatory\" id=\"24027\">24027</Link>) by replacing reference to L-Asparaginase.<br/><br/>This amendment to Part I of Schedule F to the Food and Drug Regulations amends the listing for the naturally sourced medicinal ingredient L-asparaginase to:<br/>- maintain prescription status for injectable dosage forms while providing an exemption from prescription status for other dosage forms; and <br/>- revise the name from “L-asparaginase” to “Asparaginase” consistency in terminology within the Food and Drug Regulations. L-asparaginase and asparaginase are synonyms for same substance. “Asparaginase” is the recognized common name while “L-asparaginase” is one of several synonyms. <br/><br/>With this amendment, Canada continues to be in line with the regulatory approaches of the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, where the prescription status of asparaginase is also focused on the injectable forms. These three jurisdictions also allow the use of asparaginase as a food additive. <br/>This amendment enables manufacturers to apply for market authorization of non-injectable forms of asparaginase for use in natural health products under the Natural Health Product Regulations. There is no immediate impact on manufacturers as there are currently no products on the market in Canada for the prescription exempt forms. The status of currently marketed prescription drugs containing asparaginase does not change with this amendment. <br/>This amendment does not alter existing compliance mechanisms under the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, the Food and Drug Regulations and the Natural Health Products Regulations enforced by the Health Products and Food Branch Inspectorate. <br/><br/>A regulatory impact analysis statement is available at the end of the regulations.",

Thus on 31-Aug, the European Commission referred the matter to the CHMP in order to harmonise the marketing authorisations for FEMARA in the EU.<br/><br/>Conclusion of CHMP: The CHMP came to the conclusion that the summary of product characteristics, labelling and package leaflets needed to be harmonised across the European Union.<br/>The main areas harmonised include:<br/>- 4.1 Therapeutic indications<br/>- 4.2 Posology and method of administration<br/>- 4.3 Contra-indications.<br/>In addition to these, CHMP harmonised the other sections of the SmPC including sections 4.6 (pregnancy and lactation) and 4.8 (side effects).<br/><br/>FEMARA is indicated as hormonal treatment in postmenopausal women with breast cancer.<br/><br/>Marketing authorisation holder: Novartis.<br/><br/>This document also contains the following annex: <br/>- Annex I : List of the names, pharmaceutical form, strength of the medicinal products, route of administration, marketing authorisation holders in the Member States.<br/>- Annex II : Scientific conclusions and grounds for amendment of the summary of product characteristics, labelling and package leaflet presented by the European Medicines Agency.<br/>- Annex III : Summary of product characteristics, labelling and package leaflet.<br/><br/>****",

                                    "regulatoryAbstract": "This document provides information on the need for clinical studies in children for herbal medicinal products. This is particularly important because of the frequent use of those products in the paediatric population. Although certain properties of herbal medicinal products are documented and made available, clinical information regarding the evaluation of indications, posology, length of treatment and safety is scarce. The situation of herbal medicinal products is similar to that of off-label use medicinal products: both are regularly used but have not been sufficiently evaluated, both have been available on the market for many years through multiple licence-holders, both do not possess protected intellectual property rights but they can be of significant therapeutic value to the pediatric population. It is also important to set up initiatives to stimulate the conduct of clinical studies with herbal medicinal products designed for children.<br/>This document offers the following solutions:<br/>- identification of herbal substances/herbal preparations for which a therapeutic benefit is expected;<br/>- creation of guidelines and recommendations for the development of appropriate paediatric studies for herbal medicinal products;<br/>- promotion of funding to collect more data on the safety monitoring in children and the promotion of further research.<br/>***",

This indication was originally approved under the accelerated approval, a program designed to provide earlier patient access to promising new drugs while the confirmatory clinical trials are being conducted. The FDA granted this regular approval based on results from a large randomized clinical study comparing 12 to 36 months of GLEEVEC. This trial showed an increase in overall patient survival when the drug is taken for 36 months rather than the standard 12 months of treatment. The label is being updated to include these new clinical data.",

This review took place as a result of the conclusions of three studies which showed a higher rate of new cancers in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who were being treated with REVLIMID. The CHMP undertook a benefit-risk assessment and concluded that the risk of new cancers was observed in studies in the approved population. In addition, the Committee reviewed available data from three studies in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. It came to the conclusion that the benefits of REVLIMID continue to outweigh the risks but recommended the update of the medicinal product's product information to include a warning and advice to doctors on the risk of new cancers.<br/>REVLIMID is used in combination with dexamethasone (an anti-inflammatory medicine) for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma whose disease has been treated at least once in the past.<br/>***",

A 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, AVODART is currently approved for treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men with an enlarged prostate gland.<br/>The committee also voted overwhelmingly against the risk/benefit profile for the Merck & Co product PROSCAR [ATC G04CB01] (IDRAC <Link type=\"Regulatory\" id=\"116217\">116217</Link>) (finasteride) as a treatment to reduce prostate cancer risk in men ≥ 55 years who have had a normal digital rectal examination (DRE) and a prostate specific antigen (PSA) of ≤3.0 ng/mL.

Their decision was based mainly on the robust data of one randomized, placebo-controlled trial (Study 004), and took into account the various and potentially serious adverse effects that have been associated with use of this medication.<br/>The committee members shared the concern that despite compelling testimonials and known experiences of functional improvements with tetrabenazine treatment, such improvements were not reflected in functional outcomes measured in the present studies. Nonetheless, there was strong agreement that the benefits conferred by the treatment outweigh the risks, as shown by the robust effects on chorea.

This product has a pediatric indication and a Risk Management Plan. The application submitted is a duplicate application of (GRASTOFIL).<br/><br/>Name: ACCOFIL<br/>Active Ingredient: filgrastim<br/>Company: Accord Healthcare Limited<br/>Indication:<br/>+ ACCOFIL is indicated for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes) and for the reduction in the duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation considered to be at increased risk of prolonged severe neutropenia. The safety and efficacy of ACCOFIL are similar in adults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. <br/>+ ACCOFIL is indicated for the mobilisation of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs). <br/>+ In patients, children or adults with severe congenital, cyclic, or idiopathic neutropenia with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of ≤ 0.5 x 109/L, and a history of severe or recurrent infections, long term administration of ACCOFIL is indicated to increase neutrophil counts and to reduce the incidence and duration of infection-related events. <br/>+ ACCOFIL is indicated for the treatment of persistent neutropenia (ANC less than or equal to 1.0 x 109/L) in patients with advanced HIV infection, in order to reduce the risk of bacterial infections when other options to manage neutropenia are inappropriate. <br/>Pharmaco-therapeutic group - (ATC Code): Immunostimulants colony stimulating factors - (L03AA02)<br/>Dosage form: Solution for injection/infusion<br/>Route of administration: Subcutaneous or intravenous use<br/>Packaging: Pre-filled syringe (glass)<br/><br/>Safety measures: A risk management plan has been developed to ensure that ACCOFIL is used as safely as possible. Based on this plan, safety information has been included in the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet, including the appropriate precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients.",

This medicinal product is an orphan medicinal product used for the treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukaemia who have the Bcr-Abl T315I kinase domain mutation and who are resistant to prior imatinib therapy.<br/>REASONS THAT LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL:<br/>- Results that are presented by the applicant currently do not convincingly demonstrate efficacy. The responses are mainly haematologic and seen in the chronic phase patients. Due to the large number of patients, efficacy data in CML-BP and CML-AP are currently considered as less robust in the pivotal population. It is currenly not possible to sufficiently differentiate between haematological response and unspecific haematotoxicity. <br/>The results both with regards to responses and overall survival at least in the group with worst prognosis and the largest medical need do not give the impression that the course of the disease is markedly changed.<br/>***",

On 23-Jul-2009 the application for an extension of indication requesting the addition of the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer was refused.
